# üöÄ Projects



# üíª Internships
- *Feb 2023 - May 2023*, Tsinghua University Intelligent Connected Vehicle Research Group, Beijing, China.
  - Developed a system integrating electric truck fleet scheduling and battery swapping optimization with cloud control, enhancing efficiency and reducing energy waste. In simulation experiments, using this algorithm saves $15\%$ more energy and $9\%$ more cost compared to the *Cruise Control (CC)* method.
  - Created a *Predictive Cruise Control (PCC)* for cruise control in electric trucks. Factored in road slope information and used the *Dynamic Programming (DP)* algorithm to generate efficient speed sequences, reduce energy consumption, and enhance energy regenerative capabilities.
  - Implemented cloud control for real-time fleet, environment, and infrastructure connectivity, improving adaptive driving with dynamic traffic data by using the *Genetic Algorithm (GA)*.
  - Co-authored a patent on *Battery Swapping Rhythm Planning and Predictive Cruise Control Method for Electric Heavy Truck Fleets* (Patent Number: [CN117002500A](http://epub.cnipa.gov.cn/patent/CN117002500A)).
